# Tiled Vegetation Indices

Ruby on Rails web-application that leverages **[libvips](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/)** image processing library and **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)** interactive maps library to apply [Vegetation Indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation_Index) (VIs) on [map tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map).

The approach was taken after analyzing how **[DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/)** works with VIs.

It is being published as open source to demonstrate how [WebODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM) contributors can apply VIs on-the-fly on map tiles. This approach avoids the need to store different tiles for each VI.

## Approach

It is generated a **thumbnail** of the full orthophoto. Then it is applied each one of the implemented indices on the thumbnail and is saved a **histogram** of each **index result**.

The histogram is then used to calculate a `min` and `max` used to "clip" results bellow/above min/max on individual tiles.

## Implemented Indices

### RGB based:
* VARI
* GLI
* IOR
* NGRI

### NIR based:
* NDVI
* BAI
* SAVI
* MNLI
* MSR
* RDVI
* TDVI
* OSAVI
* LAI

The method `generate_orthophoto_statistics` does generate a reduced dimension version of the full orthophoto because it is more efficient computationally to proceed with it reduced.
It then calls `run_and_store_indices_statistics` that will call `index_statistics` for each Vegetation Index that we want to use.

`index_statistics` does apply a specified Vegetation Index to the reduced orthophoto and returns it's "min" and "max" values along with their "histogram with 256 bins".

Now you can call `apply_index` for each tile generated from the full dimension orthophoto sending the "min"/"max" calculated by `index_statistics`. Or even better, you can use [findClippedMinMax()](https://github.com/dirceup/tiled-vegetation-indices/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/map.js#L166) JavaScript method to increase the contrast by ignoring "the first and last 3% histogram values" and calculating a better "min"/"max" (clipped_min/clipped_max) to use in `apply_index`.
